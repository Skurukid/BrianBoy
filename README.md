# BrianBoy
  
  He's our lovely Discord shittalking bot. He was designed after Dad Bot, but edited to be funny in polish.
  His official name is Brian Bennis, named after one of clients of our long dead friend Grolly. Godspeed you filthy coward.
  
# Installation
  
  1. Clone or download and extract repository
  2. Run npm install
  3. Run npm install discord.js
  4. Fill out config file
    4.1. Token is your discord token for bot you want to run
    4.2. Prefix is, well, prefix for some of commands. I personally use !
    4.3. Is, uh, you know Dad Bot? Like if you say "I'm hungry", he'll say "Hi hungry, I'm dad". Well, shit is thing that triggers Brian. 
         In our case it is "powiedz", because we are polish and it's considered funny I guess.
  5. To run bot just "node bot.js"
